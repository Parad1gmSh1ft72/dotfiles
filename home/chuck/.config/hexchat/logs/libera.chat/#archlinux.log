Nov 06 20:36:18 <Numero>	okay, everyone - i still have this dell optiplex 3040 that can't seem to start grub after power-up. it says "press f1 to retry, f2 for setup" etc. my grub installation shows up in the bios and shows up when i hit F12 after powerup but if i select it i get that same prompt. 
Nov 06 20:37:20 *	kaatayra935 has quit (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
Nov 06 20:37:26 <Numero>	 /boot is sda2 and it is type "EFI System" and is formatted fat32
Nov 06 20:38:00 <Numero>	secure boot is disabled and UEFI is enabled. sda is a GPT device

Nov 06 20:42:56 <alkesran>	Numero: can you try booting from any other media, like a usb drive?
Nov 06 20:43:43 <Numero>	alkesran: oh yes - the whole system is installed and ready to boot into if it would only work. booting to arch live iso and working with drives all works fine.
Nov 06 20:44:57 <Scimmia>	Numero: try the fallback path
Nov 06 20:45:54 *	ss has quit ()
Nov 06 20:45:58 <alkesran>	Numero, was grub installed with x86_64-efi target?
Nov 06 20:46:12 <Numero>	alkesran: yes - i'm sure of it
Nov 06 20:46:41 *	joey has quit (Quit: WeeChat 4.4.3)

Nov 06 20:52:56 <alkesran>	you can boot into UEFI shell from arch install iso or usb drive
Nov 06 20:53:35 <Numero>	alkesran: BTW, the bios lets me edit boot entries and it lets me browse to and speciify a file. have selected /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI
Nov 06 20:54:54 <alkesran>	yeah, that could be possible. I don't remember the dell's bios quirks 
Nov 06 20:55:13 *	cloudowind has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
Nov 06 20:55:43 <alkesran>	basically, from the UEFI shell you need to find that bootx64.efi file and execute it, like if you were in a regular bash 
Nov 06 20:55:57 <alkesran>	just to see if it error out or smth
